# Weatheroo ‚òÅ

## Stuff I learned in this project

- calling different APIs and using them how I see fit
- state management is hard
- how to implement autocomplete with a naive approach
- debouncing
- implementing microphone listener
- why it's important to separate logic from UI
- it isn't good to rely on too many APIs
- how to use stacks and draggable scrollable sheets
- use const whenever a widget doesn't have to be rebuilt
- using singletons to store data (*bad practice*)


## What the application does

It's a very basic app that either shows the weather of your current position or the one you search for. The goal was to be as simple as possible with pleasant UX. 

## What I would do differently if I did it again

- use Provider for state management
- find a list of all cities and countries for autocomplete implementation instead of using an API
- worry less about design choices and more about implementing important features first
- worry more about responsiveness
- use theme for default textstyle and such
- start refactoring sooner
- use SQLite for database (or even shared preferences in this case)
