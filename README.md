# Weather App ‚òÅ

## My Goal

Learning about asynchronous programming in Dart.
How to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What I will create

I'm going to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Angelina Skiba](https://dribbble.com/Bebachka_a) and [Mahdi Hajinejad](https://dribbble.com/shots/11113434-Weather-App).
